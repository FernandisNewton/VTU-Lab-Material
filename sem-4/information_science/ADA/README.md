| program no. | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[Program-1(a)](https://github.com/sharansk792000/VTU-Lab-Material/blob/master/sem-4/information_science/ADA/P01a.java)|Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it. (i) USN (ii)Name(iii)Branch (iv) Phone Write a Java program to create n Student objects and print the USN, Name, Branch, and Phone of these objectswithsuitable headings.|
|[Program-1(b)](https://github.com/sharansk792000/VTU-Lab-Material/blob/master/sem-4/information_science/ADA/P01b.java)|Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays.Write Push(), Pop(), and Display() methods to demonstrate its working. |
|Program-2(a)|Design a superclass called Staff  with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary.Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period).Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.  |
|Program-2(b) | Write a Java class called Customer  to store their name and date_of_birth. The date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”. |
|Program-3(a) |Write a Java program to read two integers a and b. Compute a/b and print, when b is not zero.Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.|
|Program-3(b) |Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads.First thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of the number and prints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.|
|Program-4    |Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity.Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort.Plot a graph of the time taken versus n on graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.Demonstrate using Java how the divide and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.|
|Program-5    |Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity.Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus n on graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide and- conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.|
|Program-6(a) |Implement in Java, the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming method|
|Program-6(b) |Knapsack using Greedy method|
|Program-7    |From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.Write the program in Java.|
|Program-8    |Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Kruskal's algorithm.Use Union-Find algorithms in your program.|
|Program-9    |Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.|
|Program-10(a)|Write Java programs to Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem using Floyd's algorithm.|
|Program-10(b)|Implement Travelling Sales Person problem using Dynamic programming.|
|Program-11   |Design and implement in Java to find a subset of a given set S = {Sl, S2,.....,Sn} of n positive integers whose SUM is equal to a given positive integer d.For example, if S ={1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d= 9, there are two solutions {1,2,6}and {1,8}. Display a suitable message, if the given problem instance doesn't have a solution.|
|Program-12   |Design and implement in Java to find all Hamiltonian Cycles in a connected undirected Graph G of n vertices using backtracking principle.|
